Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most lethal cancer globally and poses a significant public health challenge in Chile due to its physical and emotional impacts. This study analyzed standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for CRC using mortality data and the National Quality of Life Survey (ENCAVI) from the years 2000, 2006, and 2015. Bayesian spatio-temporal models were developed employing the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach to identify regions with unusual relative risks and associated quality of life factors. The analysis revealed that CRC SMR in Chile positively correlates with factors such as household smoking, high educational attainment, and employment status, while negatively correlating with adequate body weight, appropriate white meat consumption, and high socioeconomic status. Geographic analysis showed that the southernmost regions of Chile exhibited higher posterior means, indicating elevated SMRs. Regions with excess CRC mortality identified included Antofagasta, Tarapacá, Valparaíso, Aysén, and Magallanes. Additionally, factors related to quality of life and CRC mortality were 
identified through ENCAVI data.
